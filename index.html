      <p>Using <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Languge">HTML</abbr> entities is the right way to ensure all the characters on your page are <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referrer">validated</a>.  However, often finding the right entity code requires scanning through 250 rows of characters.</p>

      <p>This lookup allows you to quickly find the entity based on how it looks, e.g. like an <a href="?q=&lt;" rel="&lt;" class="lookupExample">&lt;</a> or the letter <a href="?q=c" rel="c" class="lookupExample">c</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="howitworks">How it Works</h2>

    <p>The lookup searches the html entities for matches to the searched character based on how your character looks. For instance, the letter <a href="?q=c" rel="c" class="lookupExample">c</a> would match &copy; and &cent; entity, because of the way they look.</p>

    <p>There's no clever logic behind this, only the most powerful computer known to man - man's own brain.</p>

    <p>Each entity has had a list of 'like' matches added to them by hand and eye.  This is stored in a local dictionary file and loaded in during start-up (since it's so small there's no point in using an AJAX like solution).</p>

    <p>The entity lookup also supports word searches and multiple searches space separated, such as <a rel="copy and cent" href="?q=copy%20and%20cent" class="lookupExample">copy and cent</a>.</p>
